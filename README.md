# C++ Simple Compiler Frontend and Custom Cout

This project consists of two main C++ components:
1.  A custom implementation of an output stream object similar to `std::cout`, named `my_cout`.
2.  A simple compiler frontend (tokenizer and parser) designed to handle integer literals and unary operators (`-`, `~`).

## Components

1.  **`my_cout.cpp`**:
    * Defines a class `MyOutputStream`.
    * Overloads the `<<` operator for basic types (`int`, `double`, `const char*`, `char`) using `std::printf` for underlying output.
    * Includes a custom manipulator `my_endl` for adding newlines.
    * Provides a global instance `my_cout` for usage similar to `std::cout`.

2.  **`simple_compiler_integers_Unary_ops.cpp`**:
    * Contains the initial implementation of a compiler frontend.
    * **Tokenizer (`tokenize` function)**: Reads input text and converts it into a stream of tokens (`INTEGER_LITERAL`, `OPERATOR_NEG`, `OPERATOR_BIT_NOT`, `SEMICOLON`, etc.).
    * **Parser (`Parser` class)**: Processes the stream of tokens generated by the tokenizer. The structure suggests it aims to parse expressions involving integer literals and unary operators. It appears intended to eventually generate some form of output (potentially assembly code, stored in `assembly_output_`).

## Features

* **Custom Output**: Provides a basic, `cout`-like interface for printing to standard output without directly using `<iostream>`.
* **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes input strings containing integers, unary minus (`-`), unary bitwise NOT (`~`), and semicolons.
* **Syntactic Analysis**: Basic parser structure to handle the token stream according to a simple grammar (likely focused on unary integer operations).

## How to Build

You will need a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later (due to the use of `<optional>`).

Assuming you have `g++` installed and have created a `main.cpp` file to utilize these components:

```bash
g++ main.cpp simple_compiler_integers_Unary_ops.cpp my_cout.cpp -o simple_compiler -std=c++17
./my_cout.cpp
./simple_compiler
